    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'Lux';
    
    // however what happens when we update that array?
    console.log(players, team);
    
    // LEARNING team is not the array itself, just a reference to an array
    
    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    
    // one way
    const team2 = players.slice();  // slice with no args will take full deep copy of the array
    team2[0] = 'team2\'s slightly underwhelming new captain'
    console.log(team, team2);

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(team)  // empty array 
    team3[0] = 'team3\'s dashing new captain'
    console.log(team, team3);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];  // ES6 'spread' to take items out of the original and into the new
    console.log(team, team4);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    team4[2] = "a brand new player that nobody knew about before. you wouldn't know him, he goes to a different school";
    console.log(team, team4);

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:

    // how do we take a copy instead?

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
