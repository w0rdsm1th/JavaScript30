/*
* Inheriting "methods"
* JavaScript does not have "methods" in the form that class-based languages define them. In JavaScript, any function can be added to an object in the form of a property. An inherited function acts just as any other property, including property shadowing as shown above (in this case, a form of method overriding).
* When an inherited function is executed, the value of this points to the inheriting object, not to the prototype object where the function is an own property.

var o = {
    a: 2,
    m: function() {
        return this.a + 1;
    }
};

console.log(o.m()); // 3
// When calling o.m in this case, 'this' refers to o

var p = Object.create(o);
// p is an object that inherits from o

console.log(p.m()); // 3 - before we set the property on the inheritor
p.a = 4; // creates a property 'a' on p
console.log(p.m()); // 5
// when p.m is called, 'this' refers to p.
// So when p inherits the function m of o, 
// 'this.a' means p.a, the property 'a' of p
